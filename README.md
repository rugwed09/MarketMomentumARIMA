"An advanced stock price forecasting tool leveraging the ARIMA model. Harnessing time series analysis to predict market trends, this repository offers insights into future stock movements, aiding data-driven financial decision-making. Dive in for cutting-edge econometric predictions
Description
This R script performs a comprehensive analysis of synthetic stock and bond prices. The analysis is divided into five phases:

Library Loading: Required libraries such as ggplot2, caret, randomForest, and forecast are loaded.
Data Collection and Preparation: Synthetic stock and bond prices are generated for 100 days.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The stock and bond prices are visualized over time.
Model Building: A Random Forest model is trained to predict stock prices based on previous stock and bond prices.
Risk Assessment: Monte Carlo Simulation is used to assess the risk associated with the stock prices.
Time Series Forecasting: An ARIMA model is fitted to forecast the next 30 days of stock prices.
Need
The script serves multiple purposes:

To understand the behavior of stock and bond prices over time.
To build a predictive model for stock prices.
To assess the risk associated with stock investments.
To forecast future stock prices.
Outcome
Visualizations: Plots showing the trends in stock and bond prices.
Random Forest Model: A trained model capable of predicting future stock prices.
Risk Metrics: Mean, standard deviation, and Value at Risk (VaR) at 95% confidence level.
Forecast: A 30-day forecast of stock prices using an ARIMA model.
Analysis
The Random Forest model uses previous stock and bond prices to predict future stock prices.
Monte Carlo Simulation provides a distribution of possible future stock prices, along with risk metrics.
The ARIMA model gives a time-series forecast for the next 30 days.
Implementation
This script can be implemented in various domains:

Finance: For portfolio optimization and risk assessment.
Investment Banking: To provide insights into stock market trends.
Asset Management: To manage and assess the performance of various assets.
Academic Research: To study the behavior of financial markets.
